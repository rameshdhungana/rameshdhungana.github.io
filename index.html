                Growing up amidst the dreams that dance like sunbeams in Nepal,
                I quickly learned that there's more to life than acing exams. In
                this land where everyone dreams of exploring the world's
                wonders, my journey reflects the simple yet powerful spirit of
                chasing dreams.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hey there, I'm Ramesh Dhungana, a Software Engineer with over 6
                years of experience. My story is about more than just studies
                and coding; it's a blend of heart, resilience, and a commitment
                to making dreams real.
                <br />
                At Old Dominion University, I was a Graduate Research Assistant
                and Lab Lead at Old Dominion University. My days involve diving
                into exciting research, implementing it into an application, and
                inspiring my fellow peers.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of technical skills, I command programming languages
                like Python, JavaScript, Typescript, C#, and Java. My expertise
                extends to web technologies such as React.js, Angular.js,
                Node.js, jQuery, Google Maps API, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and
                Material UI. When it comes to the database, I am capable to
                handle MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase Firestore, and PostgreSQL.
                Versioning tools like Git and SDLC methodologies like Agile,
                Kanban, Scrum, and Waterfall are part of my toolkit. JIRA is my
                preferred Agile Project Management tool, and for database
                management, I navigate MySQL WorkBench, MongoDB Compass, and
                Cloud Firestore. Microsoft Visual Studio and PyCharm are my
                IDEs.
                <br />
                In the realm of Cloud and Distributive Computing, I navigate
                Amazon Web Services (EC2, RDS, Route53, Load balancer, Security
                Groups) and Google Cloud (Cloud Functions, Cloud Schedulers,
                Cloud Logs, App Engine, Firebase) with ease.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond the technical domain, I seamlessly transition into roles
                of mentorship, team leadership, and collaborative team
                membership, showcasing a management skill set that complements
                my technical prowess. My journey encapsulates humility,
                intelligence, hard work, dedication, and a palette of skills
                that paint the portrait of a multifaceted individual always
                looking for growth.

            Success in professional life is attainable when we prioritize and

                What would you do differently if you were to go through the
                experience again?

            </h4>
            <p style="color: white">
              I'm thrilled with the successful completion of my internship,
              which provided invaluable learning and execution experiences.
              Looking back, there are a few things I would do differently:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Utilize Additional Display Monitors Earlier: </b>Initially, I
                used a laptop and one additional display. However, I realized
                the efficiency of using two additional displays later in the
                internship. If I were to go through the experience again, I
                would start using two displays from the beginning for faster and
                more streamlined work.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Prioritize Better Sleep: </b>Going to bed earlier would be a
                priority to ensure I get sufficient, quality sleep. Recognizing
                that a well-rested body performs better, this adjustment would
                contribute to improved productivity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Stay Hydrated: </b> I would make a conscious effort to drink
                at least 3 liters of water during work hours. Staying hydrated
                keeps the body light and aids overall well-being.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Opt for Homemade Meals for Lunch: </b> Instead of frequently
                going out for fast food, I would choose homemade meals. This not
                only saves time and money but also ensures healthier food
                options.
              </li>

            </h4>
            <p style="color: white">
              My advice to future students undertaking this internship would be
              following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Approach the internship with honesty, dedication, and effective
                communication.

              <li>
                Fulfill responsibilities diligently, recognizing that continuous
                learning is essential for personal and professional growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Utilize free time, whether on weekends or after office hours, to
                enhance skills beyond the workplace.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prioritize a healthy lifestyle by maintaining a balanced diet
                and ensuring sufficient sleep.
              </li>
              <li>
                Understand that the quality of your output reflects your
                capabilities and influences the rewards you receive in your
                career.
              </li>
              <li>
                Embrace a proactive and committed mindset, contributing not only
                to success during the internship but also to overall personal
                and professional development.
